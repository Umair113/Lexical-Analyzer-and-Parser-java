# Lexical-Analyzer-and-Parser-java

Program Input
  The input to your program will be C++ code. You will first pass this code through lexical analyser. If
lexical analyser will generate tokens in a file then your Parser program should read tokens from input file.

Program Output
  If there are no syntax errors in the program then Parser should print the following: “The program
is parsed successfully" If there is any syntax error in input program then your program should terminate
on first syntax error and print the line number of the first syntax error with error message: “Syntax Error:
Line # 3"
